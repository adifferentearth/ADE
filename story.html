		READING GUIDE!</br></br>
		[] - Narration</br>
		Leo: - Person talking</br>
		(Leo: Hmm, something isn't right..) - Character thoughts</br>
		{} - Sound Effects</br></br>
		
		Season 1: Episode 1 - Pilot
		</br></br>
		[A black bird soars through the sky, flying inbetween tree's and into the airspace</br>
		of the small town Pebbles. The bird creates a quick shadow over Leo's face </br>
		disrupting his boredom, then gently decends right outside of the window and looks </br>
		at Leo, who was laying his head down in class. He wakes up puzzled at what it was </br>
		in the air that made the shadow, then finds the bird sitting outside his window </br>
		staring at him.]</br>
		
		</br>
		(Leo: What a strange bird..)</br>
		</br>
		[Leo notices that the birds eyes are glowing red, and the beak of the bird seems to </br>
		have a small but noticable scar.]</br>
		
		</br>
		Leo: Woah.. Cool eyes..</br>
		
		</br>		
		[Leo stares at the birds eyes, seeing an image instead of a reflection. Almost as if </br>
		it's a moving image, something completely new to him. And then..]</br>
		
		</br>
		{Sounds of paper-balls flying across the room}</br>
		
		</br>
		[The Bullys throw paper-balls at Leo, Leo jumping to the surprise in fear.]</br>
		
		</br>
		{Sounds of kids laughing}</br>
		
		</br>
		Leo: Cut it out!</br>
		
		</br>
		[The teacher turns around and yells at the class]</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): ENOUGH!</br>
		
		</br>
		{Class stops laughing}</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): Edgar step outside!</br>
		
		</br>
		Edgar(The bully): It wasn't even me! Dammit!</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): NOW!
		
		</br>
		Edgar: UGH!</br>
		
		</br>
		[Edgar gets up, pushing Leo's desk aside a bit as he passes him. Then as he gets</br>
		to
		the door, he stops, looks at Leo with 
		a serious face,</br>
		then walks out slamming the door.]</br>
		
		</br>
		(Leo: Well.. seems like I'm screwed after class.. Damn it Leo.. Should've just </br>
		stayed 	shut and taken the fault like you 	always do.. I'm such an idiot.)</br> 
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): There will be no paper throwing in my class, you've all had enough</br> 
		of that	while I was away sick, and you were stuck 	with the substitute teacher,</br>
		but that's not flying with me!</br> 

		</br>
		[Leo looks back out the window and finds that the bird is missing.]</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): Leo..? Are you alright?</br>
		
		</br>
		Leo: Yes ma'am, please continue.</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): Excellent. Today we'll be talking a bit more about the science in our</br>
		world today, 
		I'm so excited!</br>
		
		</br>
		[Seth, one of the front row students raises his hand.]</br>
		
		</br>
		Seth: Excuse me teacher?</br>

		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): Yes Seth?</br>
		
		</br>
		Seth: Sorry to interrupt but, I've always wondered and it just bugs me to not ask,</br>
		but.. What does 
		the AC, from the year 
		528 A.C. mean? </br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): 528 Years ago the impact of the red glowing meteors occured.</br>
		Ever since	then the world 	has forever changed. In some ways 	for the better,</br>
		in others.. Well, can't have a an atomwithout an electron.</br>
		The A.C. Represents the meaning of the words "After Contact". </br>
		Ever since our world became or at least</br>
		was under the process of becoming what it is.</br>

		</br>
		Seth: Which is..?</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): A Different Earth.</br>
		
		</br>
		Seth: But that's just silly, the earth changes regularly. It's a natural thing</br>. 
		According
		to that logic,
		we might as well change 
		the date every 24 hours!</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): 528 Years ago, Humans couldn't jump, run, breathe	as great	as we</br>
		can today.	Ever since the global	mutation spread,</br>
		our world changed above the charts ever seen in history.</br>
		This sort of change doesn't happen every 24 hours Seth.</br>
		
		</br>
		Seth: Mutation? </br>
		
		</br>
		(Leo: Funny, you'd think the bullys would bully the nerd in class,</br>
		but I guess that doesn't
		apply</br>
		when your brother
		is Karl Durant.. Lucky you Seth.)</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): Vinitry. It is the mysterious energy introduced that very moment ago,</br> 
		528 years ago	right when the	meteors fell.	Everything became 	mutated</br>
		with the gas that the meteors contained. It flows within the blood of everybody here,</br>
		in this class.	We're all exposed.</br>

		</br>
		Liz: We're gonna die?!</br>
		
		</br>
		Teacher(Oz): No no! the contrary exactly, we're gonna survive!</br>
		Vinitry is what helps our body</br>
		endure the every day</br>
		
		</br>
