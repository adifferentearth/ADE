<h4>S01 E01 - Pilot</h4>

<p>[A black bird soars through the sky, flying inbetween tree's and into the airspace of the small town Pebbles. The bird creates a quick shadow over Leo's face disrupting his boredom, then gently decends right outside of the window and looks at Leo, who was laying his head down in class. He wakes up puzzled at what it was in the air that made the shadow, then finds the bird sitting outside his window staring at him.]</p>

<p>(Leo: What a strange bird..)</p>

<p>[Leo notices that the birds eyes are glowing red, and the beak of the bird seems to have a small but noticable scar.]</p>

<p>Leo: Woah.. Cool eyes..</p>

<p>[Leo stares at the birds eyes, seeing an image instead of a reflection. Almost as if it's a moving image, something completely new to him. And then..]</p>

<p>{Sounds of paper-balls flying across the room}</p>

<p>[The Bullys throw paper-balls at Leo, Leo jumping to the surprise in fear.]</p>

<p>{Sounds of kids laughing}</p>

<p>Leo: Cut it out!</p>

<p>[The teacher turns around and yells at the class]</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): ENOUGH!</p>

<p>{Class stops laughing}</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Edgar step outside!</p>

<p>Edgar(The bully): It wasn't even me! Dammit!</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): NOW!</p>

<p>Edgar: UGH!</p>

<p>[Edgar gets up, pushing Leo's desk aside a bit as he passes him. Then as he gets to the door, he stops, looks at Leo with a serious face, then walks out slamming the door.]</p>

<p>(Leo: Well.. seems like I'm screwed after class.. Damn it Leo.. Should've just stayed shut and taken the fault like you always do.. I'm such an idiot.)</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): There will be no paper throwing in my class, you've all had enough of that while I was away sick, and you were stuck with the substitute teacher, but that's not flying with me!</p> 

<p>[Leo looks back out the window and finds that the bird is missing.]</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Leo..? Are you alright?</p>

<p>Leo: Yes ma'am, please continue.</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Excellent. Today we'll be talking a bit more about the science in our world today, I'm so excited!</p>

<p>[Seth, one of the front row students raises his hand.]</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Yes Seth?</p>

<p>Seth: Sorry to interrupt but, I've always wondered and it just bugs me to not ask, but.. What does the AC, from the year 528 A.C. mean?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): 528 Years ago the impact of the red glowing meteors occured. Ever since then the world has forever changed. In some ways for the better, in others.. Well, can't have a an atom without an electron. The A.C. Represents the meaning of the words "After Contact". Ever since our world became or at least was under the process of becoming what it is.</p>

<p>Seth: Which is..?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): A Different Earth.</p>

<p>Seth: But that's just silly, the earth changes regularly. It's a natural thing. According to that logic, we might as well change the date every 24 hours!</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): 528 Years ago, Humans couldn't jump, run, breathe as great as we can today. Ever since the global mutation spread, our world changed above the charts ever seen in history. This sort of change doesn't happen every 24 hours Seth. </p>

<p>Seth: Mutation?</p>

<p>(Leo: Funny, you'd think the bullys would bully the nerd in class, but I guess that doesn't apply when your brother is Karl Durant.. Lucky you Seth.)</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Vinitry. It is the mysterious energy introduced that very moment ago, 528 years ago right when the meteors fell. Everything became mutated with the gas that the meteors contained. It flows within the blood of everybody here, in this class. We're all exposed.</p>

<p>Liz: We're gonna die?!</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): No no! the contrary exactly, we're gonna survive! Vinitry is what helps our body endure the every day life and form of all on this world. It's what shapes ones abilities and makes you strong!</p>

<p>Tyler: Like how I can move water sometimes?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Exactly! That is only possible because of the flow of vinitry in your body. It comes from your parents and their parents parents.</p>

<p>Tyler: But wait, my dad is the one that can move water, does that mean that I'm going to get my moms vinitry too?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Sadly no.. See vinitry is quite complex. You'll only obtain one set of Vinitry. The chances of that are 50/50. But your chances were already 
decided when you were born.</p>

<p>Tyler: Aww shucks..</p>

<p>Seth: Is it possible to have 2 types of Vinitrys?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): There are rare cases where children grow using even up to 3 sets of Vinitrys, but those are VERY rare. Last year, a word came out that a kid from the faction unlocked 4 sets of Vinitrys. Multiple sets of Vinitry are most common within people who are considered 'Prodigys'.</p>

<p>Liz: What's a prodigy?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Someone who has a larger amount of Vinitry than normal. Because of this, they can potentionally unlock multiple sets of vinitry, and/or use Vinitry to extreme heights.</p>

<p>Tyler: Am I a Prodigy?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): You can move water right?</p>

<p>Tyler: Yeah!</p>

<p>[Oz takes her cup of water and places it on Tyler's desk and says..]</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Try bringing all this water up from the cup and back down as slowly as possible.</p>

<p>Tyler: Piece of cake haha..</p>

<p>[The class seems really engaged and curious]</p>

<p>[The water slowly begins to take form and curl it's way up in spirals about 3 feet above the cup and back into the cup]</p>

<p>Liz: Wow, you're a prodigy Tyler!</p>

<p>[Liz begins to lean on Tyler in a flirtacious manner]</p>

<p>Tyler: Haha, what I said huh? Piece of cake!</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): As expected, now for the real test.</p>

<p>Tyler: Teacher say whaaa?..</p>

<p>[Oz walks accross the room to the fish tank]</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Now.. Try doing what you did there, with the water of the fish tank.</p>

<p>Tyler: Uhmm, uhh.. Can I get a bit closer?</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): Any prodigy should be able to move this and more just like how you did earlier, shouldn't make a difference.</p>

<p>Tyler: Right right.. Uhm.. What about the fish though? I mean I can't do it with the fish in there, they can die.</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): The fish should also swim along with the water being moved, they're fine. </p>

<p>Liz: You can do it Tyler! Piece of cake right?</p>

<p>Tyler: Uhm uh.. I uh..</p>

<p>(Liz smiles at Tyler, making him blush.)</p>

<p>Tyler: Like duh! Haha, ok.. Here we go..</p>

<p>(Tyler positions his hand, and tries to move with water, but nothing happens.)</p>

<p>Tyler: Hehe, I got this..</p>

<p>(Tyler uses his other hand as well and begins to focus more. And starts moving the water a little bit and little more.. then again he fails. And while breathing deeply he stands up)</p>

<p>Tyler: Next time for sure!</p>

<p>Teacher(Oz): That's enough Tyler.. You're bleeding.</p>

<p>Tyler: What..?</p>

<p>(Oz grabs some cloth and attends to tyler, the class grows silent and confused.)</p>

<p>{Sounds of heavy doors opening}</p>

<p>[The kids rush out the door as class ends]</p>

<p>Seth: Todays class lesson was pretty informing right?</p>

<p>Leo: Yeah! I think you've finally broke your record and have reached 33,000 words per minute.</p>

<p>Seth: Oh shut it! Come on you can't say you weren't amazed at the fact of how Vinitry is completely linked to everything.</p>

<p>Leo: I guess it's pretty cool if you think about it.</p>

<p>(Seth notices Leo looking at his hand as they start to walk)</p>

<p>Seth: Hey. It's alright man, you're just a late bloomer. Your Vinitry will start showing soon enough, trust me. You've got nothing to worry about. You might even get your moms super strength!</p>

<p>Leo: Yeah, I wish! Maybe then Edgar will stop clowning me around haha.. </p>

<p>[Leo notices Edgar and his friends watching Leo from the other side of the street]</p>

<p>Leo: Hey why don't you go ahead actually, I go to go and run errands.</p>

<p>Seth: It's okay I don't mind coming along.</p>

<p>Leo: No, it's fine. Trust me it's not going to be interesting at all. </p>

<p>Seth: Alright well, I'll cya later then at the lake!</p>

<p>Leo: Later.</p>

<p>[Seth walks forward down the street, Leo turns to look at the bullys then quickly makes a run into the alley]</p>

<p>Edgar: He's dead!</p>

<p>[The bullys chase after him]</p>

<p>Leo: Crap crap crap!</p>

<p>[Leo turns to look behind him and see's Edgar and the bullys catching up]</p>

<p>Leo: GOOD LUCK KEEPING UP!</p>

<p>[Edgar Grabs Leo and pushes him to the wall, as leo gets back up he finds himself cornered by the other 2 bullies]</p>

<p>Edgar: You just never learn do ya? Huh punk?</p>

<p>Eddy(Other bully): Should have just stayed with Seth Haha! You would have been safe around him.. You're useless alone.</p>

<p>Leo: Says one out of the pack.</p>

<p>Fred(Other Bully): You are useless! You don't even have a ability yet! You're scum!</p>

<p>Leo: I'll satisfy with the power to make idiots chase me Heh</p>

<p>[Edgar throws a punch unto Leo's stomach]</p>

<p>Edgar: Now now Leo, don't forget your manners!</p>

<p>[Leo grunts a bit, then get's back up and faces Edgar]</p>

<p>Leo: That.. all you got?..</p>

<p>Edgar: You little punk!</p>

<p>[Edgar grows the size of his fist]</p>

<p>Edgar: Here ya go punk!</p>

<p>[Edgar swings and punches Leo into the wall]</p>

<p>Fred(Other bully): Haha!</p>

<p>Eddy: Teach him some more bro!</p>

<p>Edgar: Did you learn your lesson now huh punk? Or do we need to review?</p>

<p>Leo: Didn't even know.. you started..</p>

<p>[Leo gets back up slowly and faces edgar]</p>

<p>Leo: I got all day.. punk..</p>

<p>Edgar: You little brat!</p>

<p>[Edgar raises his fist]</p>

<p>Stride: Hey you..</p>

<p>[The bullies look over down the alley and see Stride]</p>

<p>Stride: Why don't you pick on someone your own size?</p>

<p>Leo: It's alright man.. I got this under contr-</p>

<p>Stride: Clearly..</p> 

<p>Stride: So this is how this is going to play out, you guys are going to say some quick remarks and leave faster than I can blink or you better pray that the nearest nurse just so happened to find you guys here lying on the ground all beat up. Decide now.</p>

<p>Edgar: Do you know who you're talking to little kid? I'll beat you up right after I'm done shoving my fist onto this scums face until I'm SATISFIED!</p>

<p>[Edgar swings towards Leo.. but towards his surprise he is quickly pushed with a kick by stride in an instant]</p>

<p>Fred: What the heck!</p>

<p>Eddy: Edgar!</p>

<p>[Edgar lays dazing on the floor]</p>

<p>Eddy: You little brat!</p>

<p>Stride: You want to make the same mistake he did? Or did you just learn something?</p>

<p>[Eddy and Fred look at eachother and run to Edgar, picking him off the ground and towards the end of the alley]</p>

<p>Stride: I figured as much..</p>

<p>Eddy: You're gonna pay for this, MARK MY WORDS!</p>

<p>[The bullies are gone]</p>

<p>Leo: Thanks.. but I had that..</p>

<p>[Leo leans on the wall]</p>

<p>Stride: Sure you did, I'm stride.</p>

<p>Leo: Hey Stride, I'm Leo. How'd you do that.. thing?</p>

<p>Stride: This.. thing?</p>

<p>[Stride instantly appears ontop of the gate almost as if he's moving through electricity]</p>

<p>Leo: Amazing, you can fly?</p>

<p>Stride: Haha, not actually. I prefer the term.. jump?</p>

<p>Leo: Either way, it looks amazing.</p>

<p>Stride: Thanks.</p>

<p>Leo: As you can see haha, I can't really do anything haha.</p>

<p>Stride: Not true, you have courage.</p>

<p>Leo: Yeah.. That's always helped haha.</p>

<p>[Leo picks up his backpack and when he turns to Stride, he finds Stride already standing on ground-level]</p>

<p>Leo: Wow, you're pretty consistent.</p>

<p>Stride: Haha, takes practice. I can normally do this about 7-10 times before I give out.</p>

<p>Leo: Nice! I'm going to go over by the lake and hangout with my friends.</p>

<p>Stride: Oh Okay. Well, nice meeting you Leo!</p>

<p>Leo: Same to you, and again, thanks for sticking your neck out for me.</p>

<p>Stride: Don't mention it!</p>

<p>[The kids walk their own seperate paths.. Leo turns and asks]</p>

<p>Leo: Well actually, hey stride?</p>

<p>[Stride turns]</p>

<p>Stride: Yeah?</p>

<p>Leo: ..Can you swim..?></p>

<p>Seth: CANNON BALL!!!</p>

<p>[Seth jumps off the rock and into the water, splashing]</p>

<p>Stride: This is awesome.</p>

<p>Leo: Yeah, we come here all the time to relax.</p>

<p>Stride: Wow.. I haven't ever been this far away from the town.</p>

<p>Leo: Why not? </p>

<p>Stride: Parents.</p>

<p>Leo: Right right. My mom is pretty cool about it. 
</p>

<p>Stride: Lucky you. </p>

<p>Leo: Haha.. in some ways.. in some ways..</p>

<p>[Leo notices Tyler isn't having as much fun and is moving water a bit as he's sitting on a rock.]</p>

<p>Leo: See Tyler over there?</p>

<p>Stride: Yeah? What's wrong with him.</p>

<p>Leo: Sort of got bummed during class today, he wasn't really able to use his power to the extents of a Prodigy.</p>

<p>Stride: Well, Prodigys are pretty rare.. nothing to beat yourself up about.</p>

<p>Leo: It hurts cause, I'd give anything to be able to do what he can do right now.. and he just like.. takes it for granted. He should appreciate what he has..</p>

<p>[Leo looks at his fist, clentching it with the dirt in his hands]</p>

<p>Stride: ...</p>

<p>Leo: Anyways.. let's go try and get him into the water yeah?</p>

<p>Stride: You go I'm already freezing, I think I've had enough water for today haha.</p>

<p>Leo: Alright. </p>

<p>[Leo gets on his feet and takes a few steps away.] </p>

<p>Stride: Hey Leo?</p>

<p>[Leo turns]</p>

<p>Leo: Yeah?</p>

<p>Stride: Thanks.</p>

<p>Leo: Heh, don't mention it bro.</p>

<p>[Leo walks away towards Tyler and pushes him playfully,  Stride overhears Leo trying to cheer him up.]</p>

<p>(Stride: Bro?..)</p>

<p>[Stride looks over at the the other kids playing and splashing water at each other, then smiles]</p>

<p>[The sound of the village bell] </p>

<p>[All the kids stop talking and listen]</p>

<p>Leo: What's going on?</p>

<p>Stride: That's the bell, either the towns having a meeting or..</p>

<p>Leo: Or what?</p>

<p>Stride: Or we're under attack..</p>

<p>[The kids shake in fear and look at each other frozen by their silence]</p>

<p>Leo: Ok, it's ok. Everyone grab your stuff, we're gonna go and figure out what's going on. Quickly, let's go!</p>

<p>[The kids listen and go off to grab their things]

Stride: Father..</p>

<p>[The kids pass through the high grass holding each other's hand so they don't get lost on the way, upon reaching the end, they can hear a man giving a lecture]</p>

<p>Leo: Oh thank goodness, it's just a meeting. Phew..</p>

<p>[The kids feel relieved and begin to go their own ways towards their parents]</p>

<p>Stride: Well I should get going, I need to go stand by my father.</p>

<p>Leo: Your father? That's your father? The village leader Marx Lars? </p>

<p>Stride: Yeah.</p>

<p>Leo:  Wow cool. That explains your electric jump thingy.</p>

<p>Stride: Yeah, although he can't really jump, he can just like-</p>

<p>Leo: Yeah burn things with it I know, wow so cool.</p>

<p>Marx Lars: The faction has overstepped the line multiple times, I call this meeting to ask the people of our next option. The faction drafted our children last year, under the calling we've, like all other sections agreed upon. </p>

<p>Leo: He's talking about the draft?</p>

<p>Stride: Yeah, the one the faction does every 5 years. Where they collect kids from villages with a high potential of skills to help make them into warriors for the faction.</p>

<p>Leo: The hell they do..</p> 

<p>Stride: Our village honors this solely because of the supplies the faction trades for it.</p>

<p>Leo: Honors? Nobody honors that.</p>

<p>Stride: The trade helps the village a lot.</p>

<p>Leo: Yeah but it's cruel, we shouldn't do that. Trading people for supplies, that's like slavery.</p>

<p>Stride: My dad has been trying to get the council to agree with denying the trade for quite sometime now.. maybe that's what this is about.</p>

<p>Marx Lars: And despite all these chains that we so obliviously call bonds, we ignore the real problem. Today, we've received news that the faction will be demanding a second draft by the end of the week. They are also closing the gap from every 5 years, to every 2 years.</p>

<p>[The crowd gets angry and starts to yell]</p>

<p>Man: They aren't getting any!</p>

<p>Woman: They're not taking anymore of my children!</p>

<p>Another man: I've had enough of this crap!</p>

<p>Marx Lars: They are currently on their way. This can only end in 2 ways. Either we give them our children, or we fight back. The vote starts now.</p>

<p>Leo: This isn't good.. </p>

<p>Stride: By the looks of the crowd.. it seems we're gonna end up going to..</p>

<p>Crowd: Fight fight fight fight fight!</p>

<p>Leo: Crap..</p>
